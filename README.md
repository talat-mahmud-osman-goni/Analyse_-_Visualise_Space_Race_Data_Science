Here's I did on this dataset about the dominant organisations and the trends over time. For example:

Who launched the most missions in any given year?

How has the cost of a space mission varied over time?

Which months are the most popular for launches?

Have space missions gotten safer or has the chance of failure remained unchanged?

I also discovered many more questions that can formulate and answer with this dataset! I Useed it to practice what I learnt about creating various types of charts and visualisations, 
from choropleths to sunburst charts to segmented bar charts.
